# Green
#### A library for Processing written by Zacchary Dempsey-Plante
This is a relatively simple library designed to emulate most of the features of [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/) in [Processing](https://processing.org/).
This was done for a school project, so it will likely _not_ be maintained. 

## Installation
First, go to the Releases tab and download the .zip file, and unzip it to wherever you want to keep the library.
To install the library, simply put the .jar file in your Processing libraries folder.
Processing's `libraries` folder is located in `<sketchbookLocation>\libraries`, and it's sketchbook location can be found in the editor under `File > Preferences...`.

## Reference
To see the Javadoc reference, please visit [https://zedseven.github.io/Green/](https://zedseven.github.io/Green/).

From there, select `Sketch > Import Library...` in the editor, and Green should show up for selection.
