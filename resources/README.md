# Green
#### A library for Processing written by Zacchary Dempsey-Plante
This is a relatively simple library designed to emulate most of the features of [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/) in [Processing](https://processing.org/).
This was done for a school project, so it will likely _not_ be maintained. 

# Installation
To install the library, simply put the .jar file in your Processing libraries folder.
Processing's `libraries` folder is located in `<sketchbookLocation>\libraries`, and it's sketchbook location can be found in the editor under `File > Preferences...`.

From there, select `Sketch > Import Library...` in the editor, and Green should show up for selection.
