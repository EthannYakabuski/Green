# 'ArenaShoot'
This is an imperfect (somewhat lazy) port of a game I made for a school project several years ago by the same name, but in [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/).
It's a game where you control a tank and try to survive as long as you can in an arena - with 3 enemy types, powerups, and custom sprites.
